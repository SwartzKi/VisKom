Strawberry Plant Disease Detection using MobileNet

## Introduction
This project aims to detect and categorize diseases in strawberry plants using MobileNet, a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN). The goal is to develop an efficient and accurate model that can be deployed on mobile and edge devices to aid farmers in timely disease management.
